## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### 1. What is Software Engineering?
**Software Engineering** is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software. It emphasizes collaboration, structured processes, and quality assurance.  
**Importance**: Ensures reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions, reduces costs, and manages complexity in large systems. It bridges the gap between programming and real-world problem-solving.

### 2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering
1. **1968 NATO Conference**: Coined the term "software engineering" to address the "software crisis" of unreliable and costly projects.  
2. **1970s SDLC Models**: Introduction of structured methodologies like Waterfall.  
3. **2001 Agile Manifesto**: Shifted focus to iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.

### 3. Phases of the SDLC
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Define project goals and user needs.  
2. **Design**: Create architecture and system specifications.  
3. **Implementation (Coding)**: Develop the software.  
4. **Testing**: Validate functionality and fix bugs.  
5. **Deployment**: Release to users.  
6. **Maintenance**: Update and improve post-launch.

### 4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
| **Waterfall**                                   | **Agile**                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Linear, sequential phases.                      | Iterative, flexible sprints.                   |
| Fixed requirements upfront.                     | Adapts to changing requirements.              |
| **Example**: Building a bridge (fixed specs).   | **Example**: Mobile app development (evolving needs). |

### 5. Roles in a Software Team
- **Software Developer**: Writes code, debugs, and implements features.  
- **QA Engineer**: Tests software, identifies bugs, ensures quality.  
- **Project Manager**: Manages timelines, budgets, and team coordination.

### 6. Importance of IDEs and VCS
- **IDEs** (e.g., Visual Studio, PyCharm): Streamline coding with debugging, syntax highlighting, and plugins.  
- **VCS** (e.g., Git, SVN): Track changes, enable collaboration, and manage code history.

### 7. Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Changing Requirements**: Use Agile to adapt flexibly.  
- **Technical Debt**: Refactor code regularly.  
- **Tight Deadlines**: Prioritize tasks with project management tools (e.g., Jira).

### 8. Types of Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Validates individual components (e.g., a function).  
2. **Integration Testing**: Checks interactions between modules.  
3. **System Testing**: Tests the entire system end-to-end.  
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Ensures the software meets client requirements.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### 1. Prompt Engineering
**Definition**: Crafting precise inputs to guide AI models toward desired outputs.  
**Importance**: Reduces ambiguity, improves response quality, and saves time.

### 2. Example of a Vague vs. Improved Prompt
- **Vague**: "Write about dogs."  
- **Improved**: "Write a 200-word article on the benefits of adopting rescue dogs, focusing on emotional and social aspects."  
- **Why Better**: Specifies length, focus areas, and audience, leading to a structured and relevant output.
